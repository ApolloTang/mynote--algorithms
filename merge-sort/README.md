# Merge Sort

There are two functions in the merge sort: `divide()` and `combine().` The sorting magic is happening in the `combine()` function.  The magical step that do comparison in `combine()` can work because left array and right array both has already being sorted (Ref 1).

The magical step that do comparison in combine() is called the **2 finger algorithm** see Ref 4, 2, 3
